River Watch
=====================================


In preparation for the R Meetup talk on using github to make websites, I made the following interactive plot.  I have to say on a per line basis, this might be the neatest 4 lines of code I have written in awhile.

FYI - This is a plot of RiverWatch Sites in the Roaring Fork Valley.

Also note - this is an Rpub document, not a github.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8}

location <- read.csv("../data/dsn_pull/MonitoringLocationsExport (1).csv")
#devtools::install_github("rstudio/leaflet")

library(leaflet)

m = leaflet() %>% addTiles()
m %>% addCircles(data=location) %>% addMarkers(data=location, popup=location$Name )

```
